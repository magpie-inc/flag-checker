# Welcome to Magpie Inc

## Flag-Checker 9000
Did you know that the band DEVO took their name from the idea of "de-evolution?" That's right, the guys in DEVO thought that humanity was getting stupider. Luckily, we here at Magpie Inc. are here to prove them wrong. Need an example? Look no further than our first fully-automated release, the Flag-Checker 9000!
